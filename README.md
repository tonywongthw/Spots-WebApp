# Inspiration

A day before the hackathon, one of our teammates went to the speed networking event. He met someone who had just moved to his area and was asked about places they should explore and visit. In that moment of his brain going blank, he thought of a way to easily, personally share the best spots in his area. “Spots!” Was born.

# Features

Spots! Does 3 things. Upon completion, it will give users

1. A profile page to select 5 of their favourite places.

2. A personal code for them to share.

3. Input personal code of friends to view the friend's 5 spots.
